You need RStudio as well as the packages used to be installed into RStudio before you can properly run the program.

The purpose of this assignment is to analyze a dataset, which contains the data of staffs of 
an organization. This data could help determine faults in the human resources management. This 
will require the proper pre-processing of the given dataset. For further assumptions, conclusions 
and every analysis in the middle, the data will need to be thoroughly explored, manipulated, 
transformed, and visualized. Any assumptions and analysis will need to be validated. This will 
help identify any problems in the organizational management and provide important data for 
further decision making.

To insert the dataset given (as a CSV file) into our environment, I declared the dataset as 
“e_attrition” and imported it via the following commands. Header is set to TRUE for isolating the 
top row entries as headers.
